# Licence-Compatibility-Wizard
A simple guide for choosing compatible licenses for application in subsequent software projects that addresses researchers / students has been created. This guide can be conceptually modelled into a directed graph. Licence Compatibility Wizard automates the processes of compatibility control and detection of breaches in terms of licenses for programs of open-source software. The implementation is based on various sources such as existing graphs of compatibility licenses, real texts of licences, licenses fora, as well as the official website of OSI. It is a cross-platform, user- friendly application which can be expanded for future updates or alterations of the existing graph.
